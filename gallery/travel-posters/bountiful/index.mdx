I have learned from sad experience that when working with AI, the more specific
your vision for the image, the more disappointed you will be with the output.

This piece is from my early days of working with generative AI, and it hasn't
been updated because I can't get Midjourney to fully capture my vision. This
version is basically what I want, but as you can see, it's very much an
AI-generated image. The colors are right, the vibe of the buildings is right,
and the temple is loosely "like unto the temple of Solomon"[^solomon] (in that it's more
square than pyramid-shaped and has more than one pillar). The houses also look
like they could be made from wood. Unfortunately, no amount of Photoshop (at
least at my current skill level) is going to fix the trees with their awkwardly
long trunks, the slightly funky path, or make the buildings look less strange.
Still, it's got the right vibes, so here it is: a monument to my first idea for
a Book of Mormon travel poster.

[^solomon]:
    2 Nephi 5:16 (I know Nephiâ€™s temple is not the same as the temple in
    Bountiful, but since they continued to follow the Law of Moses until at least 3
    Nephi 11, I imagine their temple construction would still be 'like unto the
    temple of Solomon.')
