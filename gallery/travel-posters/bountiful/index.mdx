I have learned from sad experience that, when working with AI, the more specific
your vision for the image you want, the more disappointed you are with the
output.

This one is back from my early days of working with generative AI, and it hasn't
been updated because I can't get Midjourney to capture my vision. This version
is basically what I want, but as you can see it's very much an AI generated
image. The colors are right, the vibe of the buildings is right, the temple is
very loosely 'like unto the temple of Solomon'[^solomon] (in that is more square
than pyramid and has more than one pillar), and the houses look like they could
be made from wood. Unfortunately, no amount of Photoshop (at least at my current
skill level) is going to make the trees not have awkwardly long trunks, or the
path not be a little funky, or the buildings be less weird... but it's got the
right vibes, so here it is: a monument to my first idea for a Book of Mormon
travel poster.

[^solomon]:
    2 Nephi 5:16 (I know that Nephi's temple here is not the same as the
    temple in Bountiful, but I am imagining that since they are still following the
    Law of Moses up until at least 3 Nephi 11 that their temple construction will
    continue to be 'like unto the temple of Solomon')
