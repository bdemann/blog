This was inspired by a sacrament meeting talk, that, I'm guessing, was inspired
by a John Bytheway talk about the war chapters in the Book of Mormon.

In Alma 47 Amalickiah was conspiring to become king of the Lamanites and a large
portion of the Lamanite army were "fixed in their minds with a determined
resolution that they would not"[^alma47:6] go to war with the Nephites.

[^alma47:6]: Alma 47:6

They followed their leader Lehonti to "the top of the mount which was called
Antipas" [^alma47:7] and there waited for Amalichkiah to launch his attack.
Amalichkiah however didn't intend to attack them but rather subtly persuade to
give up on their determined resolution.

[^alma47:7]: Alma 47:7

Amalickiah invited them to come down from the mountain to meet with him and
they refused. Then he changed his tactics. He went most of the way up the mount
and asked them to come down only a little bit to meet him.

They did, and it led to them eventually falling all the way into his trap.
Lehonti was murdered, "poison[ed] by degrees"[^alma47:18], by Amalickiah, and
Amalickiah gained control of the whole Lamanite army and used their power to
help him secure a position not only as the leader of their army but as king over
all of Lamanites.

[^alma47:18]: Alma 47:18

So when you are tempted to come down from your standards, even a little.
Remember to Stay on Lehonti's Mountain, and don't come down!
