Ever since reading Tennis Shoes among the Nephites, I have been captivated by
Chris Heimerdinger conception of Jacobugath as the capital city of the
Gadianton Robbers. The Gadianton Robbers are my favorite villains in the Book
of Mormon, you love to hate them. Heimerdinger's Jacobugath had a Mesoamerican
setting, but mine is more of a heartland take, so maybe it was a little snowy
up in the north.
