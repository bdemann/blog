Ever since reading Tennis Shoes Among the Nephites, I’ve been captivated by
Chris Heimerdinger’s conception of Jacobugath as the capital city of the
Gadianton Robbers. The Gadianton Robbers are my favorite villains in the Book of
Mormon—you love to hate them. Heimerdinger’s Jacobugath had a Mesoamerican
setting, but my version is more of a "heartland" take, so maybe it was a little
snowy up in the north.
