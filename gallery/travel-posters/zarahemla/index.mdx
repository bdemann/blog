As with Bountiful, I had high expectations for this, but ultimately I had to
settle and move on. I managed to get something decent from Midjourney, enough to
make it print resolution... though maybe a lower resolution would help hide the
oddness of the human figures (if that's what they are) in the foreground. Itâ€™s
good enough as a placeholder, but not my best work.
