As I was reading these verses for Sunday School, I was impressed by how much symbolism was packed into their covenant.

Moroni tears his coat to make the title of Liberty, in response "the people came
running together with their armor girded about their loins, rendering _their_
gargemtents in token, or as a comenant, that they would not forsake the Lord
their God," and that if they did "the Lord should rend them even as they had
rent their garments."[^alma46:21]

[^alma46:21]: Alma 46:21

I found that to be a very powerful duel image. Both in memory of the Title of
Liberty, which itself was a symbol of the things there were fighting to protect,
combined with the penalty of violating their covenant.

And then they added another layer to it

> 23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
>
> 24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he saidâ€”Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.
>
> 27 And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.

Moroni reminded them of their ancestry, and of the prophecy of Jacob that as a
remnant of Joseph torn coat was preserved, so should a remnant of Joseph's seed
be preserved. Part of Moroni's coat was preserved and made into the title of
Liberty, and those that fought for liberty and fought for their God, religion,
freedom, peace, wives, children[^alma46:21], were also preserved miraculously
just as Joseph was himself miraculously preserved in Egypt and played a part in
the miraculous preservation of himself, his family and all of Egypt during the
great famine.

[^alma46:21]: Alma 46:21

To illustrate these symbols I worked with Midjourney to create this piece:
Remnant of the Seed of Joseph. Pictured is a remnant of the coat of many colors,
much of its symbolism has already been explained above as part of our covenant
relationship with God. The branch represents the scattering of Israel,
hearkening to the branches of the olive trees taken from their mother tree and
planted in the nether most part of the vineyard[^jacob5], especially in this
case, the Nephites who where a preserved part of of the tribe of Joseph (through
Manasseh) who is a fruitful bough... whose branches run over the wall
[^genesis49:22]. The wheat both represents the vision Joseph saw where his
brothers' sheaves made obeisance to his own[^genesis37:7], and of the miraculous
preservation of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob's covenant seed during the great
famine[^genesis45]. The cup represents the silver cup that Joseph placed in
Benjamin's sack, reminding us of the brother's reunion[^genesis44], and of the
yet future day when Christ will gather Israel and He shall reign over them and
the whole Earth during the millennium.
