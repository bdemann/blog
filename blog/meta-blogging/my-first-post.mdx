I find myself on occasion writing out my thoughts in order to better wrap my
head around them. I think about a lot of stuff, religion, politics, culture,
technology. I figured I'd throw out my thoughts here, worst case scenario,
nobody cares, and it's the same as leaving them, best case scenario, someone
else finds these musings and gets some benefit from it. That's all for now, I
want to post this and play around with organization.
