I started reading this book, a collection of essays, edited by Matthew L Harris
and Newell G Bringhurst. In it, various author, each a scholar focused on Mormon
history and/or religious thought, analyze and respond to the Gospel Topics
Essays that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (hereafter referred
to as “the church”) published about 10 years ago. As a faithful member of the
church, I had a lot of feelings about this book. The essays ranged from inane to
intriguing.

While I am lacking in credentials (I am neither a historian nor a theologian), I
am not lacking in opinions. Since our church runs on lay people doing their
best, I feel like my opinions as a long-time orthodox lay person mean something,
so here they are.

The introduction gives a bit of history of the coming forth of the Gospel Topics
essays. This particular account frames the essays as being released by the
church in response to the growing number of people that, equipped with the
internet, were starting to find troubling things in church history. The Gospel
Topics Essays were, according to this introduction, released begrudgingly, in an
effort to address these concerns and prevent a mass exodus from the church. I
guess the idea is that, previously, the church leaders were able to have
complete control over the narrative, but they reluctantly had to concede that,
in the digital age, that was a luxury they could no longer enjoy.

Which leads me to the question: Is the church really hiding uncomfortable truths
about its history?

## Where I am coming from

I have some problems, not with how the church allegedly covers up its own
history. My problem is that I don’t understand what people think the church is
hiding.

I suppose there could be things that the church is hiding so well, that I
haven’t heard about them yet, but it doesn’t seem like that’s what people are
talking about. I usually hear the complaint in the context of polygamy, or the
seer stone, or the Book of Abraham, or just as a vague “Oh yeah they are
covering up a lot of stuff,” and in those regards I don’t really connect with
the feeling that the church is trying to cover up its shady past.

My impression, as someone that grew up in the church, was that the church
acknowledged most, if not all, of these things before. Granted it’s not like
they were teaching about polygamy in the missionary lessons, but I grew up
knowing most of this stuff somehow. If people feel like they weren’t in the know
about something, then I would pass it off as being obscured by an open secret or
assumed knowledge not from a nefarious history rewrite[^1]. Nowadays, however, the
church does seem to be a bit more open about controversial topics, it’s still
not in the missionary lessons mind you, but there seems to be an increasing
amount of resources available on the subjects[^2].

Is that an acknowledgement of past deception and history hiding? I wouldn’t say
so.

It seems to me that the church was simply focusing on teaching the Gospel, as
they should. It seems reasonable[^3] that given the age of the internet and the
lies that Satan puts into the hearts of men[^4], that the church felt it wise to
adopt an additional strategy for helping people build their faith and thus
produced a resource where people can go to get plausible explanations that
corroborate the traditional teachings.[^5]

It’s easy for you, you might think, to say all that, after all, you were born
and raised in the church, your four great grandfather was with Joseph Smith in
Carthage when he died. Your ancestors were among the pioneers that settled Utah.
Polygamy is part of your family history. You don’t need to have the missionary
lessons to cover everything because everything is all around you all the time.
How can you possibly understand what it feels like when a person first learns
about this stuff?

You’d be right, I don’t understand, and hopefully as part of this, I will
understand better, but I also hope that you understand, that as a long-time
orthodox member, I grew up knowing most of this stuff. Some of it was
uncomfortable to learn, especially as I grew older and understood more of the
nuances and implications, so I understand why people have a hard time grappling
with some of these topics, I had had my own faith crises where I had to decide
if I felt like I believed in the church. I get that. But I feel baffled that
people think this stuff was being kept secret.

Let’s get back to the book, The LDS Gospel Topics Series. The book has thirteen
essays, each one address one of the Gospel Topics Essays. Looking through the
Gospel Topics Essays I am realizing that I have not read most of them. My basic
approach then is going to be as follows:

1. Establish my preexisting knowledge on the subject. Explore what I know about
   it, how I learned about those things, what my reactions were to learning about
   them, and how secretive the church was about it.

2. Read the Gospel Topics Essay. Respond to it generally. Talk about what, if
   anything, I learned while reading it.

3. Read the corresponding essay in The LDS Gospel Topics Essays. Respond to it.
   Determine if I felt like it was a fair response. Address things that I thought
   were interesting. Address things that I think are ridiculous[^6].

Along the way I hope to answer the following questions:

-   Is the church hiding things?
    -   Is my experience and perspective as a long-time member enough evidence
        to decide that outcome one way or another?
-   What are the things that bother people so much? Why are these things so
    troubling?
-   What are the things that they feel like the church wasn’t and still isn’t
    being forthcoming about?
-   What were the things that I learned that made me start my faith crisis, and
    what did I learn that got me out of it?
    -   What role does skepticism and science play in this pursuit? What role
        does faith play? How can they work together? Can they work together?
-   As a long-time orthodox member of the church what are my opinions on the
    Gospel Topics Essays?
-   Is the church being progressive enough in their response? Or maybe too
    progressive? Or just right?
-   How much room for interpretation is there?
-   Which things are gospel truth and which things are still up for debate?
-   As a long-time orthodox member of the church what are my opinions on the
    essays in The LDS Gospel Topics Series: A Scholarly Engagement

Notes:

[^1]:
    The most generous concession I can give is that, maybe the church was
    hesitant to acknowledge some things, but I don’t think they ever denied them. I
    grew up knowing most of them so I feel really uncomfortable with the idea that
    someone could believe that the church is hiding it all.

[^2]:
    For example, the Gospel Topics Essays or the Let’s Talk About series. I’m
    guessing they will never be in Preach My Gospel, but I don’t feel like it
    makes sense to include them there anyways.

[^3]:
    If you accept the premise that church is true and the First Presidency and
    Quorum of the Twelve are inspired, or at the very least accept that they are
    well intentioned earnest believers

[^4]:
    I’m not saying that all things that all critics of the church say about the
    church are lies, but I’m also not saying that they are all true either. My
    first testimony shaker came from a friend that told me a medley of things
    about the Book of Abraham, some of which were true, most of which were
    oversimplified, and many of which were downright incorrect

[^5]:
    The phrase “plausible explanations that corroborate the traditional
    teachings” is a quote from By Means of the Urim and Thummim by James W.
    Lucas and Jonathan Neville that has really resonated with me and I hope that
    is what I am providing here. I’m not trying to submit a definitive answer or
    an apologetic response. I just want to demonstrate that there is at least
    one plausible story that allows for most/all of the critical things to be
    true while allowing for the church to also be true.

[^6]:
    As a point of clarification, at the time of publishing this introduction to
    my response I have already read a couple of the essays and written rough
    drafts of my responses, but I have not finished reading the book. My pattern
    for approaching this review developed over the first couple of essays, so
    those first responses won’t follow the prescribed pattern exactly.
