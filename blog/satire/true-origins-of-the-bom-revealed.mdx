Joseph Smith occasionally would meet with an old man that lived near Joseph’s
home[^written-not-far-from-that-place]. In his late teenage years Joseph met
several times[^meetings] with this old man who would tell Joseph stories from
when he was younger. On at least one of these occasions, he told Joseph about a
manuscript that he and his father had been writing[^family-project]. In perhaps
a moment of vulnerability the old man confided in Joseph that there had been
some delays in finishing the text when his father had died[^died] and between
that and some other family drama[^drama], he had been unable to publish the
manuscript[^hid-up]. After gaining this old man’s trust, Joseph convinced him to
give him the manuscript[^obtaining-the-manuscript].

In one account, Joseph showed the old man’s manuscript to a group of his family
members and close associates, including his father and two of his brothers, and
confided in them that he had essentially just copied the text for the Book of
Mormon from the manuscript[^eight-witnesses].

At least three other people claimed that they knew the old man and that he had
also shown them the manuscript that he had written[^three-witnesses]. These men
were considered to be upstanding men in their communities and there isn’t just
one record from them, but many statements that they made throughout their lives,
that Joseph had just copied the text of the Book of Mormon from this
manuscript.[^never-renounced]

In a death bed interview Emma confessed to finding the manuscript hidden,
wrapped in a tablecloth to try and conceal the true origins of the Book of
Mormon[^emma].

Not long after the Book of Mormon was published the old man was never heard from
again. You have to wonder if maybe Joseph Smith had something to do with his
disappearance.
