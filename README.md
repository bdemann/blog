# The Benjamin DeMan Blob

I am lacking a proper README, but hopefully you may enjoy reading this:

> Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life.
> Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him
> will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.
>
> Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth,
> and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am
> in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his
> name.
>
> I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
> and the end.
>
> And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.
> And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I
> baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of
> their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and
> with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.
>
> â€” _3 Nephi 9:14-15, 18, 20_
